    "overview": "sys-ej is a malicious package. This is a \"dependency confusion\" package, which means the package name is based on existing repositories, namespaces, or components. It aims to trick users into downloading a package that contains malicious code by spoofing or impersonating a legitimate company or product.\n\nThese spoofed packages have no relation to the company or project they are attempting to spoof, and are not published by them or associated with them in any way.\n\nUsers should verify that the package they are using has been downloaded from the official source and not from the general package distribution repository. Snyk cannot automatically identify where a package has been downloaded from and will mark any use of the package as malicious to allow users to check whether they have been compromised.\n\nThis package contains malicious code that uses information-stealing malware, and steals the developers` data."
